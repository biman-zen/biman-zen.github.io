### My story
I hold an M.Sc. (2012) and B.Sc. (2010) in Aerospace Engineering from Purdue University. For over 12 years, I have worked in the defense industry, specializing in Finite Element Analysis (FEA) on complex structural designs. FEA involves discretizing 3D geometry into elements to perform various design evaluations (stress, modal, dynamic, etc.). Depending on the size of the model, FEA can generate volumes of numerical data. I leverage extensive MATLAB scripting and Excel to wrangle, tidy, and visualize these structural analysis datasets. Through years of exposure to complex simulation outputs, I have become adept at translating messy engineering data into clear, actionable insights.
