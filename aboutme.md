### My story
I am a graduate of Purdue University in Aerospace Engineer with a MSc. (2012) and BSc. (2010). I have spent over 12 years in the defense industry performing finite element analysis (FEA) on structural designs. Finite element analysis involves discretizing 3D geometry into elements to perform various types of analyses (stress, modal, dynamic, etc.). Depending on the size of the model, FEA can generate volumes of numerical data. Tidying that data and visualizing it is cruicial. I performed this post-analysis data wrangling with Matlab and Excel. Having to parse through various files required me to write extensive Matlab scripts. Through years of exposure, I have become adept at making sense of messy engineering data.
